Description: tiny window manager
 TinyWM is a small, simple window manager.  It has a minimal memory
 footprint, which makes it useful in embedded systems.  It features window
 move, resize, and raise operations, and supports "sloppy focus".
 .
 Due to its simplicity, its source code (in C and Python) can be used as a
 reference implementation for developers seeking to understand basic window
 manager programming.
